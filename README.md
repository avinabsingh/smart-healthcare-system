Web-based Smart Healthcare Management System

## Project Overview
The Smart Healthcare Management System is a web-based platform designed to digitally manage healthcare operations such as patient registration, appointment booking, doctor scheduling, and medical record management. The system replaces manual and fragmented hospital processes with a centralized, secure, and efficient digital solution.
